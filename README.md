# Space Station Game

## Running

`npm start`

colors may depend on your terminal

## Playing

Manage a space station by trading with docked ships, assigning crew to modules, while managing resources. Inspired by Dwarf Fortress, FTL, Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup

## Wishlist

better main menu viz of vessels and their tradeable resources

station attraction and promotion (calculated from a value in modules)

faction goals (ex, 50 credits/day or total vessels docked or something) 

heat resource that builds up and needs to be given away?

science resource that is sold/given to certain vessels

getting modules from solving problems

modules should allow unique solutions to problems

Module ideas:
- tractor beam
- short-range teleporter
- cryotanks (unassigned crew don't take food or air!)
- biodome (grow food)
